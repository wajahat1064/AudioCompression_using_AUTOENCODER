# AudioCompression_using_AUTOENCODER
# Machine Learning is replacing previous techniques in each field
# So I thought why not try Machine Learning to compress the audio and open-source it to the community

Nodes for each layer can be tweeked, you can compress an audio upto 35 TIMES or even more (I haven't tried it myself because it was enough for me but you obviously can)!
Your dataset to train the AutoEncoder Model needs to be .wav files since the libraries used in the code are not quite friendly with other formats.

#Must note that the compression is for Data Transfer and Data Transmission not Storage since you will get a pickle file which you can decode later!

If you have a problem getting the dataset, feel free to reach out to me @ waheed@pnw.edu
