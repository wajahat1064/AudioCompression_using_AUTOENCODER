# AudioCompression_using_AUTOENCODER
Nodes for each layer can be tweeked, you can compress an audio upto 35 TIMES or even more (I haven't tried it myself because it was enough for me but you obviously can)!
Your dataset to train the AutoEncoder Model needs to be .wav files since the libraries used in the code are not quite friendly with other formats.
If you have a problem getting the dataset, feel free to reach out to me @ waheed@pnw.edu
